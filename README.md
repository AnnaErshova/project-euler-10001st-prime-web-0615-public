# Project Euler

## Problem: Multiples of 3 and 5

- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...` 
- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4 million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Instructions
- Code your solution into the `lib/even_fibonacci.rb` file. 
- Run your `rspec` test suite, and make each RSpec test pass.
